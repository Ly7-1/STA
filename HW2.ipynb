    "summary\n",
    "We started with a simple Markov chain chatbot that generates text based on single-word transitions. It tracked how often each word followed another word in a corpus, building a probability model to predict the next word.\n",
    "Extension #1: Bigram Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot was extended to use bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) instead of single words, improving the context and accuracy of word predictions. By considering two words together, this version captured more coherent word sequences.\n",
    "Extension #2: Character-Specific Word Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final extension, we introduced character-based modeling by associating word sequences with specific characters in a dataset. This allowed the chatbot to learn how different characters speak and respond, storing word transitions and patterns for each character independently. This version made the chatbot capable of generating more realistic, character-specific dialogue.\n",
    "These extensions progressively enhanced the complexity and realism of the chatbot, transitioning from basic word prediction to more nuanced character-specific dialogue generation. The final model is useful in situations where diverse personas or characters need to be represented, like in dialogue systems for games, movies, or multi-character chatbots."

    "To summarize, we explored a Markovian chatbot implementation, starting with a basic version that tracks individual word transitions and then extending it to handle bigrams (word pairs) and trigrams (sequences of three words), while incorporating context based on different characters. This advanced model allows the chatbot to predict the next word based on richer context (two preceding words) and generate text that mimics the unique speech patterns of different characters in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps create more contextually relevant and coherent text, especially in dialogue systems where character-specific language is important.\n",

However I am just new to programming, but I can use chatbot to help me solve problems that I wouldn't be able to right now. I can use chatbot to help me solve the problems that I don't know now, and I can ask chatbot to help me solve the problems that I don't understand in lecture.\n",

    "Chatbot is great, it's so powerful. When I was in high school in China, I heard about chatbot's amazing abilities. And many people recommended that I could learn to use this tool.Indeed chatbot handles statistics and programming it can be very precise about what I want. And gives me very detailed answers. It saves a lot of time. But while I was using it for my statistics homework, I realized a serious problem. I relied on it too much. It seriously affected my desire to read knowledge. Because there are some problems that I need to watch textbooks or instructional videos on the internet over and over again before I can understand them, but chatbot can do it for me straight away, with just a very common command from me. All in all, there is no doubt about its capability. But I think it's better not to rely on it too much."

    "I had barely used chatbot before I took this class in statistics. when I first started this class the professor had us use chatbot. i had some questions about chatbot because before I didn't even know that it could help you with so much of the code in the assignment. It's definitely a great tool for a new programmer. The first time I used chatbot in statistics was in the first tutorial. the TA and the classmates next to me showed me how I could get chatbot to help me find a satisfactory answer to my question. Later on in the lecture, the professor talked about a lot of codes and functions that I haven't learn before, and since English is my second language, I didn't keep up with the teacher's progress in the class. So I would give my questions to the chatbot, which was very important to me in the lecture."

    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding and statistics are important in many data science roles, but there are non-technical roles within the field, such as data visualization, business analysis, or product management, that don't require deep expertise in those areas.\n",
    "You can use low-code/no-code tools and focus on areas like data visualization, data governance, or business intelligence, which rely more on domain expertise and communication skills.\n",
    "To increase your long-term potential in data science, it's beneficial to gradually improve your coding and statistical skills using beginner-friendly tools and resources.\n",
    "Ultimately, a mix of technical skills and soft skills (communication, adaptability) will allow you to thrive in the data science industry, especially if you're working closely with technical teams."
